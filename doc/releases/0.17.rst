SoCo 0.17 release notes
***********************

**SoCo 0.17** adds a single new feature and updates SoCo to work on
top of the API changes that Sonos introduced with the 10.1 software
update.

.. warning::
   The changes to SoCo to accommodate the Sonos API changes as of
   version 10.1 are **backwards incompatible**. This means that if
   SoCo is updated to version 0.17, then *it will be necessary to
   update the Sonos software to â‰¥10.1* at the same time.


`SoCo (Sonos Controller) <http://python-soco.com/>`_ is a simple Python class
that allows you to programmatically control Sonos speakers.

New Features and Improvements
=============================

* Add the ``is_soundbar`` property to the SoCo class to indicate
  whether or not the current instance represents a Play:Bar, a
  Play:Base, or a Beam and, when appropriate, enable features like
  Night and Dialog mode. (Pull request `#637
  <https://github.com/SoCo/SoCo/pull/637>`_). (Fixes `#633
  <https://github.com/SoCo/SoCo/issues/633>`_).
