Welcome to SoCo's documentation!
================================

SoCo (Sonos Controller) is a high level Python 3 library to control your
`Sonos <www.sonos.com>`_ Â® speakers with::

    # Import soco and get a SoCo instance
    import soco
    device = soco.discovery.any_soco()

    # Get all albums from the music library that contains the word "Black"
    # and add them to the queue
    albums = device.music_library.get_albums(search_term='Black')
    for album in albums:
        print('Added:', album.title)
	device.add_to_queue(album)

    # Dial up the volume (just a bit) and play
    device.volume += 10
    device.play()

To get up and running quickly with *SoCo*, start by reading the
:ref:`getting started <getting_started>` page, with :ref:`installation
instructions <installation>` and a small :ref:`tutorial <tutorial>`
and then wet your appetite with the :ref:`micro examples
<examples>`. Then optionally follow up with any of the advanced topics
that pique your interest: :ref:`speaker_topologies`, :ref:`events` and
:ref:`upnp_services`. Finally dive into the :ref:`the full module
reference documentation <module_reference>`.

If you have a question, start by consulting the :ref:`FAQ <faq>`. If
your question remains unanswered, post a question in the `SoCo/SoCo
Gitter chat room <https://gitter.im/SoCo/SoCo>`_ or in the `SoCo
Google group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/python-soco>`_.

If you are interested in participating in the development, plase read :ref:`the
development documentation <development_topics>` and `file a bug
<https://github.com/SoCo/SoCo/issues>`_ or `make a pull request
<https://github.com/SoCo/SoCo/pulls>`_ on `Github
