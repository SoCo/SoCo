"""A play local music files example

To use the script:

 * Make sure soco is installed
 * Drop this script into a folder that, besides python files, contains
nothing but music files
 * Choose which player to use and run the script at the command line as such:

play_local_files.py "Living Room"

NOTE: The script has been changed from the earlier version, where the
settings were written directly into the file. They now have to be
given at the command line instead. But, it should only be necessary to
supply the zone name. The local machine IP should be autodetected.
