""" Sample script to demonstrate use of SoCo snapshot

This is useful for scenarios such as when you want to switch to radio,
an announcement or doorbell sound and then back to what was playing previously.

To use it just change the IP address to one of your Sonos players.

This script will:
 - start playing a radio station
 - take a snapshot of the status of the sonos player (what playing, volume etc.)
 - play an alert mp3 for a few seconds (a poem!)
 - re-instate the sonos player to it's previous state (the radio station)

Note: The Snapshot class is designed for single use. If a second snapshot is
required create another instance of the class e.g. `snap2 = Snapshot(device)`.
