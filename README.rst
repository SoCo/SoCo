SoCo
====

SoCo (Sonos Controller) is a Python library that allows you to
control `Sonos speakers`_ programmatically. It was originally created at `Music
Hack Day Sydney`_ by `Rahim Sonawalla`_ and is now developed by a `team of
people`_ at its `GitHub repository`_

For more background on the project, please see Rahim's `blog post
<http://www.hirahim.com/blog/2012/04/29/dissecting-the-sonos-controller/>`_.

Visit the `SoCo documentation`_ for a more detailed overview of the functionailty.

WARNING
-------

Sonos has changed the way music service account information is available. This means that **currently a group of music service will give authentication issues and cannot be used at all**. Known members of this group are: Google Play Music, Apple Music, Amazon Music, Spotify and Napster.

Issue #557 is a meta issue for this problem and you can use that to track progress on solving the issues, but
*please refrain from posting "me too" comments* in there. Also, there is no need to open any more separate issue about this.
If you have another music service that should be on the list, comment in #557

**As of v0.26.0, nascent music service support has been reinstated, with some known issues. Testing and issue reporting
would be appreciated.**

Installation
------------

SoCo requires Python 3.6 or newer.

Use pip:

``pip install soco``


SoCo depends on a number of Python packages. If you use pip to install Soco,
the dependencies will be installed automatically for you. If not, you can inspect
the requirements in the `requirements.txt <https://github.com/SoCo/SoCo/blob/master/requirements.txt>`_
file.


Basic Usage
-----------

You can interact with a Sonos Zone Player through a SoCo object. If you know
the IP address of a Zone Player, you can create a SoCo object directly:

.. code:: python

    >>> from soco import SoCo
    >>> my_zone = SoCo('192.168.1.101')
    >>> my_zone.player_name
    Kitchen
    >>> my_zone.status_light = True
    >>> my_zone.volume = 6


But perhaps the easiest way is to use the module-level `discover` function.
This will find all the Zone Players on your network, and return a python
set containing them:

.. code:: python

    >>> from soco import discover
    >>> for zone in discover():
    ...        print(zone.player_name)
    Living Room
    Kitchen


If you prefer a list to a set:

.. code:: python

    >>> zone_list = list(discover())
    >>> zone_list
    [SoCo("192.168.1.101"), SoCo("192.168.1.102")]
    >>> zone_list[0].mute = True

Of course, you can also play music!

.. code:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    from soco import SoCo

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        sonos = SoCo('192.168.1.102') # Pass in the IP of your Sonos speaker
        # You could use the discover function instead, if you don't know the IP

        # Pass in a URI to a media file to have it streamed through the Sonos
        # speaker
        sonos.play_uri(
            'http://ia801402.us.archive.org/20/items/TenD2005-07-16.flac16/TenD2005-07-16t10Wonderboy.mp3')

        track = sonos.get_current_track_info()

        print(track['title'])

        sonos.pause()

        # Play a stopped or paused track
        sonos.play()

**Socos** is a command line tool for controlling Sonos devices. It is developed
in conjunction with Soco, but in a `separate repository <https://github.com/SoCo/socos>`_.

**SoCo-CLI** (`soco-cli <https://github.com/avantrec/soco-cli>`_) is a powerful and
fully-featured command line tool suitable for use in scripts, scheduled tasks, etc. It
supports time-based and state-based actions, and repeated commands using loops. Audio
files on the local filesystem can be played back directly on Sonos from the command line.
Multi-household Sonos systems are supported.
