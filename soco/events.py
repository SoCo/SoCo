"""Classes to handle Sonos UPnP Events and Subscriptions.

The `Subscription` class from this module will be used in
:py:mod:`soco.services` unless `config.EVENTS_MODULE` is set to
point to :py:mod:`soco.events_twisted`, in which case
:py:mod:`soco.events_twisted.Subscription` will be used.  See the
Example in :py:mod:`soco.events_twisted`.

Example:

    Run this code, and change your volume, tracks etc::

        logging.basicConfig()
        import soco
        from pprint import pprint
        from soco.events import event_listener
        # pick a device at random and use it to get
        # the group coordinator
        device = soco.discover().pop().group.coordinator
        print (device.player_name)
        sub = device.renderingControl.subscribe()
        sub2 = device.avTransport.subscribe()
