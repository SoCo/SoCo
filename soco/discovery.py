def discover(timeout=5, include_invisible=False, interface_addr=None):
    """ Discover Sonos zones on the local network.

    Return an set of SoCo instances for each zone found.
    Include invisible zones (bridges and slave zones in stereo pairs if
    `include_invisible` is True. Will block for up to `timeout` seconds, after
    which return `None` if no zones found.

    Args:
        timeout (int): block for this many seconds, at most. Default 1
        include_invisible (bool): include invisible zones in the return set.
            Default False
        interface_addr (str): Discovery operates by sending UDP multicast
            datagrams. interface_addr is a string (dotted quad) representation
            of the network interface address to use as the source of the
            datagrams (i.e. it is a value for IP_MULTICAST_IF). If None or not
            specified, the system default interface for UDP multicast messages
            will be used. This is probably what you want to happen.

    Returns:
        (set): a set of SoCo instances, one for each zone found, or else None.

    Note:
        There is no easy cross-platform way to find out the addresses of the
        local machine's network interfaces. You might try the
        `netifaces module <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/netifaces>`_ and some
        code like this::

            >>> from netifaces import interfaces, AF_INET, ifaddresses
            >>> data = [ifaddresses(i) for i in interfaces()]
            >>> [d[AF_INET][0]['addr'] for d in data if d.get(AF_INET)]
            ['127.0.0.1', '192.168.1.20']

            This should provide you with a list of values to try for
            interface_addr if you are having trouble finding your Sonos devices
